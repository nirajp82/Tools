Razor views are compiled at runtime by the ASP.NET MVC framework. When a user requests a page, the server-side code in the Razor view is executed and generates an HTML response that is sent back to the user's browser.

During the compilation process, the Razor view is translated into executable code that can be executed by the .NET Framework. This process involves generating a class that represents the Razor view, which is then compiled into an assembly that can be executed by the server.

To add logs during the Razor view compilation process, you can use the System.Diagnostics namespace in your C# code. You can use the Debug.WriteLine method to output information to the Visual Studio Output window or a log file. For example, you could add the following code to output a message when the Razor view is compiled:

```
using System.Diagnostics;
// ...
Debug.WriteLine("Compiling Razor view...");
```
To debug issues with Razor view compilation, you can use the built-in debugging tools in Visual Studio. Set breakpoints in your C# code and step through the code to identify any issues. You can also use the Visual Studio Output window to view debug messages and exceptions that occur during compilation. Additionally, you can enable compilation tracing to get more detailed information about the compilation process. To do this, add the following line to your web.config file:


```
<compilation debug="true" targetFramework="4.8">
  <assemblies>
    <add assembly="System.Web.Mvc, Version=5.2.3.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" />
  </assemblies>
  <buildProviders>
    <add type="System.Web.Mvc.ViewTypeBuilder, System.Web.Mvc, Version=5.2.3.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" />
  </buildProviders>
  <trace enabled="true" pageOutput="false" />
</compilation>
```
